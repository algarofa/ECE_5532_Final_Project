# Package generates a sample of diff. trajectories and then assigns a cost to each one.

sim_time: 1.0 #trajectory travel time, how far ahead
vx_samples: 3 #number of speed samples to consider
#vy_samples: 3 #only for meccanum drive robots
vtheta_samples: 10 #number of yaw rater to consider
controller_frequency: 20.0 #how times per sec to compute twist command
min_vel_x: 0.1 #min speed to consider
max_vel_x: 0.7 #max speed to consider
min_vel_theta: -1.0 #min yaw angle
max_vel_theta: 1.0 #max yaw angle
acc_lim_x: 2.5 #regulates speed accel. 
acc_lim_theta: 3.2 #regulates yaw rate accel. 

gdist_scale: 0.8 #discourages going far from the angle of trajectory of the desired position (can keep robot from turning away from goal)
pdist_scale: 0.8 #discourages going faraway from the trajectory of the global planner
occdist_scale: 0.01 #penalizes the robot from entering padding zones and lethal spaces

global_frame_id: map
holonomic_robot: false #meccanum drive robot will require this set to true, diff drive robot will require false
