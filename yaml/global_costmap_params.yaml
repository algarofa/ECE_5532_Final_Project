robot_radius: 0.5 # m, radius of the robot
transform_tolerance: 0.2 # secs, wait for transform (how old the information can be, higher tol. means more error)
update_frequency: 5.0 # Hz, how often the lidar data is used to update the map (higher freq. more comp. expensive, polar to x,y to global x,y to costmap values)
publish_frequency: 2.0 # Hz, how fast the costmap is published to the planner, rviz, or other nodes
rolling_window: false # false = global, true = local
